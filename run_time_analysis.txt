Task0.
------
Get items from Python lists is O(1) in 1 print statement happens in constant time, so the
the runtime for Task0 is O(1).

Task1.
-----
Task1 contains 1 for loop, taking input from 1 list, and inputting into another list,
if certain conditions are met. Assuming that the input list can be very
big, complexity is O(n).

Task2.
----
This task has 1 for loop, taking 1 list as input, populating a dictionary with the
elements of a list, of which one value of the dictionary is calculated in the
for loop. Again, assuming the list might be large, this algorithm's complexity
is O(n).

Task3.
-----
Task3's complexity is O(n), since it has 2 for loops, taking the same list as input.
The size of the list might be large, so O(n).

Task4.
-----
In this task, a list is passed into a function, in which a for loop populates a
set, if a certain condition is met. The size of the list is indeterminate, so
O(n).
