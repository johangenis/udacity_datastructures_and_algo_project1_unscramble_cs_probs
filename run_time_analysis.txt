Task0.
------
Get items from Python lists is O(1) in 1 print statement happens in constant time, so the
the runtime for Task0 is O(1).

Task1.
-----
Task1 has 1 for loop, taking input from 1 list, and inputting into a set,
if certain conditions are met. Assuming that the input list can be very
big, complexity is O(n).

Task2.
----
This task has 2 for loops, taking 1 list as input, populating a dictionary with the
elements of a list, of which one value of the dictionary is calculated in the
for loop. In the second for loop, 1 iteration through the dictionary returns
the value with the highest value - so: 0(n) + 0(n) = 0(2n). With increasing input,
the time complexity will be 0(n).

Task3.
-----
Here we have 2 for loops, so, again - 0(n) + 0(n) = 0(2n).
The size of the list might be large, so O(n).

Task4.
-----
Here, again, we have 2 for loops, so - 0(n) + 0(n) = 0(2n).
The size of the list might be large, so O(n).
